# sscp

This is a collection of APIs intended to represent a secure SDLC control plane.

The idea behind this is to model the SDLC as a flow of inputs, processes, and ouptuts. This lets us better understand how the data flows between the various systems within the SDLC and in many cases utilize OpenAPI tooling to help us generate the scaffolding needed to actually implement the systems securely.

**Note:** This is currently just a project being built out and is in no way ready for production. The APIs are not versioned yet and won't be for a while.

# Examples

**Note:** None of the examples have been tested yet and are just auto generated with `openapi-generator-cli`.
